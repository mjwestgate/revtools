\title{Shiny app for screening articles by their full-text}
\description{This is a simple app for displaying DOI links and bibliographic data one entry at a time, and manually selecting or excluding them. Articles can be ordered by a user-specified column, or or in one of three automated ways: as in the input dataset, alphabetically by title, or in random order (the default).
}
\usage{
screen_full_texts(x, max_file_size)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An (optional) object of class \code{data.frame} or \code{bibliography} to open in the browser. If empty, the app will launch with no data. Data can be added within the app via the 'import' button.}
  \item{max_file_size}{Optional argument to set the maximum file size (in MB) that the app will accept.}
}
\value{
This function launches a Shiny app in the users' default browser, allowing the user to select or exclude individual articles.
}

	\code{\link{screen_titles}} for screening articles in groups rather than individually; \code{\link{screen_topics}} to view articles as a point cloud; \code{\link{screen_abstracts}} for screening articles by their abstract.
